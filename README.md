# API Events
This project is an API for event management with file uploads, integrating AWS services to send images to S3 and use RDS (Relational Database Service).

## Key features:

File Uploads: The API allows users to upload files for events, which are then securely stored in an S3 bucket.

Database Integration: The API connects to an RDS instance, ensuring the data associated with file uploads is properly managed and stored.
